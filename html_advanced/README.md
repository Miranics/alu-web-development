## Project Overview

This project aims to teach and solidify your understanding of advanced HTML concepts. The focus is on building semantic and structurally sound HTML from a provided wireframe. You’ll learn how to translate designs from Figma into code, creating web pages using **pure HTML**. Styling (CSS) and scripting (JavaScript) will be covered in future projects, but this project focuses strictly on the structure and content.

## Resources

Before you start, here are some important resources to read or watch:

- [Learn to Code HTML & CSS](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/) (Focus on sections until "Creating Lists" included)
- [Introduction to HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
- [MDN Web Docs: HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to:

- Understand what **HTML** is and its role in web development.
- Explain **markup languages** and the **Document Object Model (DOM)**.
- Create an **HTML page from a wireframe**, following best practices and semantic structure.
- Identify and use common **HTML tags** and **attributes** effectively.
- Understand the purpose of essential HTML tags, including `<!DOCTYPE>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`, and more.
- Build a **W3C-compliant** HTML file and validate it using the **W3C Validator**.

## Key Concepts

- **HTML (HyperText Markup Language):** A standard language for creating web pages and web applications.
- **Wireframe:** A visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a website, which you'll use to structure the webpage.
- **Markup Language:** A language used to annotate or structure text in documents, indicating how parts of the document should behave or be displayed.
- **DOM (Document Object Model):** A programming interface that allows scripts to update the content, structure, and style of HTML documents dynamically.
- **Tags/Elements:** HTML tags are the building blocks of an HTML page, typically enclosed in angle brackets (`< >`). Example: `<p>`, `<h1>`, `<a>`, etc.
- **Attributes:** Additional information provided to elements in HTML. For example, `<img src="image.jpg" alt="description">` where `src` and `alt` are attributes of the `<img>` element.

## Project Requirements

- All files should end with a new line.
- A **README.md** file at the root of the project is mandatory.
- External libraries are not allowed. This project should be built with only **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** (no **NodeJS**, **React**, **VueJS**, **Bootstrap**, etc.).
- Your HTML code must be **W3C-compliant** and should pass the [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/).

## Tasks

### 0. README and Objectives!

In this task, you will focus on creating a detailed `README.md` file for your project and outlining the objectives clearly. Additionally, you'll be implementing a webpage based on a designer file provided in **Figma**.

- **Designer File:** The webpage design is available on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), and you can access it [here](#) (Link to be provided by your instructor). Make sure to **duplicate** the design to your drafts to access all design details.
- **Fonts:** If your computer is missing fonts, you can find them [here for Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro) and [here for Spin Cycle OT](#).
- **Values in Float:** Some values in the design may be in float (decimal form). You are allowed to round these values when implementing the webpage.

## Getting Started

1. **Set up your project folder**:
    - Create a directory `html_advanced`.
        - Inside this directory, create your `README.md` file and start adding the details about the project.
            - Add your HTML files as you start building your webpage from the provided Figma design.

            2. **Clone or duplicate the Figma design**:
                - Visit the provided Figma link and duplicate the project to your drafts.
                    - Pay attention to the structure and elements in the design as you translate them into HTML.

                    3. **Write HTML based on wireframe**:
                        - Open a text editor (e.g., **VSCode**) and start creating the HTML structure.
                            - Focus on semantics and proper use of HTML elements.
                                - Ensure each file you create ends with a new line, as required.

                                ## Validation

                                Once you’ve completed the HTML structure, validate your code using the [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/).
